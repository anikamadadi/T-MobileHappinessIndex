3,Bob,2025-12-23,"Tech, Price, Maintenance, Billing",I went through the Sprint break-up. Inherited T-Mobile. I had auto pay. Then T-Mobile changed their policy. Now they charge you $5.00 if you do not give them your debit card for the auto pay. WOW! Maybe I should charge them $5.00 a month for staying with them. Anything to make a buck. I'm looking a new cell provider that would appreciate my credit card auto payment on a credit card. With everything that is going up. Who needs the extra cost.

4,Ray,2025-11-08,"Customer Service, Coverage, Price, Punctuality & Speed, Honesty & Transparency","Honest assessment. I do have some background knowledge of phones and communications. Linda and I have been slowly combining things we both paid. Houses, insurance, living expenses as we get more settled in. One of the things we saw we could combine was our cell accounts to save some real $. I had ATT and she had T Mobile. After looking and discussing we decided we would consolidate me into T Mobile since some of the perks were better. I was very hesitant since I had heard good and bad about T Mobile. I have a hunting camp in rural Caldwell Parish so I was skeptical. It was worth the risk because ATT since their 5G migration is trash coverage almost everywhere, and they are not cheap. My summation is TM couldn't be much worse.
I have been pleasantly surprised by TM! It's coverage and speed beat ATT in almost every area I frequent. Even at the camp. Good thing is if you are in a fringe area or dead zone it creates a uplink to Starlink so your phone doesn't have connectivity as long as you are outdoors. It works to automatically, so there is no manual toggling back and forth. This is really a game changer for cell Services. The service we are on is priced very competitively. Definitely saving us some real $$. My opinion is worth what u paid for it...$0. jJust a heads up! May be worth looking into. We are on the Magenta 55+"

I had gone into the store the day before and employee scanned my id that was attached to an old account be fore I was married (1998) and should have been closed . This means the merging or cancelled account was not the account I went in store for - I reset password and should have been helped with them calling T-Mobile on the phone in person- instead they sent me away and said call them on your own.
Only to have spent 8 hours 4 till 9m to get no where for there was two accounts in my name one should have been cancelled long ago! The next morning T-Mobile activation dept was to call me to help and never did. So I spent three hours in person that day with Mario helping me to get my Sereno and fixed. Mario was kind - listened to me - he got what I was saying got on the phone after pulling up both my accounts /he canceled the old account - spoke with the activation dept - got my numbers corrected and I ended up buying a phone from Mario. He took the time to help me - he listens and even though I did not go in to up grade my phone - he made the sale just knowing this nice, kind and profession man - was helping me! Was worth buy a new phone in return!!! Maybe his co worker could learn something from compassion and kindness. Thank you Mario!"

1,Petey,2025-06-10,"Customer Service, Coverage, Price, Refunds & Payouts","I looked at the coverage map for where I live and it says I have coverage. I have a newer phone and my signal bars fluctuate and I get 4G LTE, 5G and 6 and on wifi, yet my phone keeps going into Emergency Calls Only mode, searching, or varying T-Mobile service. Even when I have T-Mobile service, texting and calls don't work. I can scroll on social media all day long without issues but trying to make or receive calls or texts, the phone is useless. Even when I go to other places, cities, downtown, I don't have good signal. Customer service has just told me to reset my phone, put it on airplane mode, reset wifi and none of it works. I'm carrying and paying for a rectangle just to scroll on social media. T-Mobile will be dropped just like my signal. Don't waste your time and money, it's not worth the stress and frustration."

2,Mary,2024-11-05,"Customer Service, Price, Billing","I have had nothing but issues with T-Mobile billing. I had a set plan and changed it to add a line along with internet. Each month they have an excuse why it's changed. I mean from $161 to over $300. Each month it is a different excuse then they give me a set amount and next month it is that. Then next month the bill is outrageous again. We have the military plan because it is supposed to be less expensive than the senior plan. Seems like I can't win. I will absolutely be dropping T-Mobile as soon as the phones are paid off. I don't have time or the funds to deal with this each month. I am very disappointed. We had T-Mobile for a number of years and we're very happy with it but for some reason, we have had nothing but issues. Not at all satisfied!"

We always had significant connectivity issues when calling to and from Veneta, and the video-call function almost never worked; it was spotty if she stayed in the house, but as soon as she'd go outside, the video would drop. Our connectivity within CA was always great. The four lines cost about $136/month. When Mom passed away this past June, our remaining three lines were about $105/month. I had asked for a better deal about eight months ago but was told none were available. I recently read in Consumer Reports that changing to a reputable non-Big 3"" carrier like ** could save us up to $40/month"

2,Christina,2024-02-01,"Customer Service, Sales & Marketing, Punctuality & Speed, Online & App, Staff, Billing","I’ve been a T-Mobile customer for probably over a dozen years but lately, I’ve noticed the customer service is lacking. Most of this I believe is because they can’t find people who actually want to work in the store and help people. This seems to be an ongoing theme with most companies post-COVID. I went to the store to try to resolve an issue and literally waited for an hour for someone to help me because there was only two people there and one of them was training. When I finally got help, the person clearly didn’t know what to do because he was new so he ended up funneling me over to calling customer service and that person could not figure out my problem either.
The problem I had was that I was switching service to Mint Mobile. I paid off the phone and paid off the bill but T-Mobile decided to lock my phone until they had a revised bill? I’ve never heard of anything so ridiculous in my life. I tried to get help through the app and their app is also ridiculously stupid. After two days I was able to find a competent customer service rep and my phone was literally unlocked over the phone in about 30 seconds. Talk about frustration. Maybe this is the new normal. Zero to no customer service."
